&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea behind this project is to explore the prospect of self-driving cars by creating a top-down 2-D car simulator. The goal is to let the car learn how to navigate itself using virtual distance sensors, neural networks and some aspects of genetic algorithms. The machine learning model used in this project is similar to reinforcement learning, where AI cars which go off track are stopped while ones that make it further can be saved and replicated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have 5 sensors attached to a car that will act as the input neurons for the Neural Network, visualized the 5 inputs will be connected with a weight to a hidden layer with 6 nodes, which are also connected to a layer of 4 output neurons that correlate each possible movement direction.
